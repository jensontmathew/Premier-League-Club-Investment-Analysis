participated in premier league (assume that it has the data for all clubs). It includes data on the number of goals scored, the number of times they have finished in the top two 
positions and other relevant details.

The management of the firm aims to invest in one of the top-performing club in the English Premier League. To aid in their decision-making process, the analytics department has been 
tasked with creating a comprehensive report on the performance of various clubs. However, some of the more established clubs have already been owned by the competitors. As a result,
the firm wishes to identify the clubs they can approach and potentially invest to ensure a successful and profitable deal.
